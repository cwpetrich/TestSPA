# TestSPA
In the name of Science!

I am testing the latest dotnet core 3.0 templates and this is my first attempt.

Creation:
dotnet new react --auth Individual -o TestSPA

Required changes to get to functional state:
https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.0/preview/3.0.0-preview-known-issues.md
(All that applied to SPA's with authentication)
